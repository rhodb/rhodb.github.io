## Overview of the class

Being a teaching assistant for an intro class is a lot of fun because you are in a position where you can really inspire students, which I consider to be the most powerful aspect of teaching. My focus when I TA-ed for this class was to make the information (i) as digestible and then (ii) as interesting as possible. I firmly believe that the effort it takes to make information accessible is much outweighed by the benefit of affording someone the opportunity to process information more quickly, which gives them more time to think deeply about it and this I argue increases the chance they will be inspired in some way. So, for these classes, I made myself think much deeper about the field, and I tried to distill the core analytical principles of the field as well as find connections to other fields the students may have been more familiar with. As a teaching assistant, I was responsible for doing a one-hour discussion section once a week, hosted office hours once-twice a week, graded homeworks and fielded many questions via email.
