## Brief description

This project was for the class Time Dependent Data (STAT 33600) taught by Professor [Wei Biao Wu](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~wbwu/){:target="\_blank"}. I analyzed the Central England Temperature (CET) series, which is one of the largest data sets for temperatures. This report was a pretty short, only 13 pages, but I found there to be some evidence in support of global warming although not as strong as others have suggested. I did not have time to analyze this data in great depth, so please take these conclusions with a grain of salt. This project was more of an exercise on analyzing a data set with significant correlations in time.
