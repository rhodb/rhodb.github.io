## Overview of the class

I liked being a teaching assistant for this course because it covers material I am personally more interested in, and it is the first time that the students face serious challenges in learning how to (i) extract linguistic patterns from data and (ii) abstract away principles from these patterns. My goal was still to inspire students, and I found it even more important to make the information digestible for them in this class, as some of the principles in phonology are paramount to understanding contemporary linguistics in general. This class was also interesting in that it is a mix of detailed reality (acoustic phonetics, articulatory phonetics) and abstraction (phonology), so it was fun to try to bridge and motivate that transition, which was new for most students. A part I was heavily involved in was the midterm, which was a phonetics project on their own dialect. I will talk about this more in the [materials page](https://rhodb.github.io/projects/ta-phoneticsphonology). Basically, I helped them record their measurements, process their measurements and gave them resources to help analyze the data they collected. I was the only teaching assistant for this class.
