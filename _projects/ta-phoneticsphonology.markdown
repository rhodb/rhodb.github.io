## Overview of the class

I liked being a teaching assistant for this course because it covers material I am more interested in, and it is the first time that the students face serious challenges in learning how to (i) extract linguistic patterns from data and (ii) abstract away principles from these patterns. My goal was still to inspire students, and I found it even more important to make the information digestible for them in this class, as some of the principles in phonology are paramount to understanding contemporary linguistics in general. This class was also interesting in that it is a mix of detailed reality (acoustic phonetics, articulatory phonetics) and abstraction (phonology) away from this reality, so it was fun to try to bridge and motivate that transition, which was new for most students. A part I was heavily involved in was the midterm, which was a phonetics project on their own dialect. I will talk about this more below.


## Materials

I was responsible for leading a discussion each week that was one hour in length. There were forty-four students and only me, so I found it a bit hard to figure out exactly what I should focus on each week, so there was such variance in the group. As with Introduction to Linguistics, I often lectured / reviewed for half of the period and then had an activity or fielded questions the second half. There are lecture materials sitting in the same notebook mentioned on the [page](https://rhodb.github.io/projects/ta-intro) for when I was a teaching assistant for Introduction to Linguistics, and I will at some point get around to making slides or digitizing those notes.
