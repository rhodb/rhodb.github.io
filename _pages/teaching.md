## Lecturer
### LING 20001: Introduction to Linguistics (Spring 2020)

This course is the first core course for the linguistics major at the University of Chicago. I taught one of two sections during the Spring 2020 quarter. I split lecturing duties with [Kathryn Montemurro](https://voices.uchicago.edu/kmontemurro/), who taught the other section. I taught the sections on acoustics, articulatory phonetics, syntax, semantics and pragmatics. You can find the materials on the [project page](https://rhodb.github.io/projects/teaching-intro) I have for this course. I was responsible for every aspect of my section: asynchronous lectures three times a week; synchronous class periods three times a week; office hours twice a week; creating exercises and solutions; creating homeworks and solutions as well as grading them (every other week); creating and grading exams; and fielding questions over email.
