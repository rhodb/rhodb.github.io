## Lecturer
### LING 20001: Introduction to Linguistics (Spring 2020)

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to teach the first core class for the linguistics major at the University of Chicago. I had an excellent group of students who made it so much easier and more fun to teach the course, given that this was right after the coronavirus started spreading in the United States and we had to do this course completely remote. I taught this course with Kathryn Montemurro who is an awesome linguist who focuses on sign languages (and who matriculated to the university the same year I did!). We tried the 'flipped classroom' format: we made asynchronous lecture videos, and then we hosted synchronous classes where the students had the opportunity to somewhat direct the trajectory of that module with their questions and discussion. Since it was after all an introductory course, Kat and I often prepared materials for each of the synchronous sessions to help guide the students and encourage them to go deeper into some material we considered important or interesting if they didn't have any questions and just wanted more practice. I taught the sections on acoustics, articulatory phonetics, syntax, semantics and pragmatics. You can find the materials on a [project page](https://rhodb.github.io/projects/teaching-intro) I have for this course. I was responsible for every aspect of the course: lectures three times a week; office hours twice a week; creating exercises and solutions; creating homeworks and grading homeworks; creating exams and grading exams; and fielding questions over email.

## Teaching Assistant
### LING 20001: Introduction to Linguistics (Autumn 2017, Winter 2019)

Being a teaching assistant for an intro class is a lot of fun because you are in a position where you can really inspire students, which I consider to be the most powerful aspect of teaching. My focus when I TA-ed for this class was to make the information (i) as digestible and then (ii) as interesting as possible. I firmly believe that the effort it takes to make information accessible is much outweighed by the benefit of affording someone the opportunity to process information more quickly, which gives them more time to think deeply about it and this I argue increases the chance they will be inspired in some way. So, for these classes, I made myself think much deeper about the field, and I tried to distill the core analytical principles of the field as well as find connections to other fields the students may have been more familiar with. As a teaching assistant, I was responsible for doing a one-hour discussion section once a week, hosted office hours once-twice a week, graded homeworks and fielded many questions via email.

### LING 20101: Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology

This is typically the first core course students take after they have taken Introduction to Linguistics. I liked being a teaching assistant for this course because it covers material I am personally more interested in, and it is the first time that the students face serious challenges in learning how to (i) extract linguistic patterns from data and (ii) abstract away principles from these patterns. My goal was still to inspire students, and I found it even more important to make the information digestible for them in this class, as some of the principles in phonology are paramount to understanding contemporary linguistics in general. This class was also interesting in that it is a mix of detailed reality (acoustic phonetics, articulatory phonetics) and abstraction (phonology), so it was fun to try to bridge and motivate that transition, which was new for most students. A part I was heavily involved in was the midterm, which was a phonetics project on their own dialect. I will talk about this more in the materials page. Basically, I helped them record their measurements, process their measurements and gave them resources to help analyze the data they collected. I was the only teaching assistant for this class. I was responsible for doing a one-hour discussion section once a week, hosted office hours once-twice a week, graded homeworks and fielded many questions via email.
