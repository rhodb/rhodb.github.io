Hello, I’m a sixth-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics and a second-year Master’s student in the Department of Statistics at The University of Chicago. This is my personal website, which I basically look at as an extension of my resume and CV; so, if you found something interesting in one of those documents (or perhaps on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/rhodb){:target="\_blank"}), I hope this site will provide at least some of the details and further information you may want. I've tried to organize it in a reasonable way, but *please* feel free to email me at `bprhodes@uchicago.edu` with any questions about the projects or suggestions on how I can make them better or organize their presentation so that it is easier for someone who is not me to consume what is there. 

As I alluded to above, I've received training in both linguistics and statistics, in that order, which means the majority of my earlier work is more in linguistics proper and the later work has more variety in topics / data-to-be-analyzed but has an emphasis on quantitative analysis and incorporation of statistical methods. I *really* enjoy carefully looking at data, trying to figure out what can be learned from it and then finding ways to use that knowledge. As most statisticians do now-a-days, I have experience using various machine learning tools, such as the ever-explosive / ever-exciting family of deep neural network models. The 'pure' machine learning experience I have is mostly with NLP and speech. My training in linguistics makes working on these problems interesting and a bit more intuitive when it comes to understanding what a model is (not) doing. Though I have not done much work in this area, I am pretty interested in sports data. Stay tuned for a project of that nature!

I hope that gives a decent overview of my experience, skillset and interests, but please feel free to contact me with any questions.
